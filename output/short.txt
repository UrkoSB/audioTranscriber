 Do you want to speed up your software development process?  You can do one thing.  You can use something called a ORM tool.  Now using this tool, let's say if you have a Java project,  in this Java project you have different objects  and normally what you do is you want to store this data  which is then the object in the database  and to do that you use something called SQL query.  So as a developer, you are building an application  and also you are writing SQL query  so that you can save data in database.  But what if I say you don't have to write SQL queries.  Just write the Java code  and whatever object you want to store, just say save.  The moment you say save,  the data will be stored in the database  without you have to write the SQL query.  And for this you can use any ORM tool  which stands for object relational mapping  which will take your objects  and convert that into a SQL query  because your classes and your tables are similar.  So any ORM tool, example,  Hibernate, Django ORM and there are multiple  which will help you to speed up your development.
